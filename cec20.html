<p>Deep learning has shown significantly promising performance in addressing real-world problems, such as image recognition, natural language processing and self-driving. The achievements of such algorithms owe to its deep structures. However, designing an optimal deep structure for a particular problem requires rich domain knowledge on both the investigated data and the general data analysis domain, which is not necessarily held by the end-users. In addition, the problem of searching for the optimal structure could be non-convex and non-differentiable, and existing accurate methods are incapable of well addressing it. Furthermore, the deep structure defined for the task is not reusable, i.e., a new one must be redesigned for data with a slightly changed scenario and/or unseen data. </p>

<p>
Evolutionary computation (EC) approaches, particularly genetic algorithms (GAs), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic programming (GP), have shown superiority in addressing real-world problems due largely to their powerful abilities in searching for global optima, dealing with non-convex/non-differentiable problems, and requiring no rich domain knowledge. However, most of the existing EC methods currently work only on relatively shallow structures, and cannot provide satisfactory results in searching for deep structures. In this regard, deep learning structures designed by EC approaches, i.e., evolutionary deep learning, would be a great research topic. </p>

<p>
The theme of this special session aims to bring together researchers investigating methods and applications in evolutionary deep learning. Particularly, the methods focus on effective and efficient representations, search mechanisms and optimization techniques. Authors are invited to submit their original and unpublished work to this special session.</p>
